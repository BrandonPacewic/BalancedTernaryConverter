# Balanced Ternary Converter

## Version 1.2

----

#### Binary 

Binary is the representation of numbers in base two, Shown as 1s and 0s

The number 5 in binary is represented as 101 as 5 contains one 4 and one 1

2^2 2^1 2^0

----

#### Ternary

Ternary is similar in this way however insted of base two it becomes base three, shown as 0s, 1s, and 2s

The number 5 in ternary is represented as 012 as it contains one 3 and two 1s

3^2 3^1 3^0

----

#### Balanced Ternary

Balanced Ternary takes this one step farther 
Insted of showing numbers as 0s, 1s, and 2s they are shown as 0s, 1s, and -1s

The number 5 in balanced ternary is represented as 1 -1 -1 as it contains one 9 one -3 and one -1

3^2 -3^1 -3^0

The method applied to accomplish this shown in this code is extreamly inefficient.
Please keep in mind that this code could eaisly be shortaned and improved upon
simply by using division and the modulous operator. However, such simpler 
methods can be found online and the use of loops and variable size containers
such as 'Vector' is extreamly useful for educational purposes. Enjoy :)
